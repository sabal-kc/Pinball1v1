# Pinball 1v1

A modification to the classic pinball game in C++ by adding multiplayer feature. This project was done as a part of the Object Oriented Programming course.

Language: C++

Libraries used: SFML

The collision detection and physics logic have been implemented by ourselves. The assets were designed using photoshop. The main objective of the project was to get familiarized with OOP concepts. The application of OOP to develop a simple game helped to gain a clearer understanding of OOP concepts. Many concepts in game development and physics systems were also learned from this project.

### Steps to install
The project can be opened in visual studio. SFML library has to be added for compilation. The final project files are inside the Pinball Versus folder.
